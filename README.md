🤝 Team Collaboration Reflection
This project marked our first time working together as a team, and we were not previously close. Despite the initial unfamiliarity, we made several key decisions that shaped both the project and our collaboration:

Clear Division of Responsibilities: We decided to split the project into frontend and backend tasks based on individual strengths and interests. This allowed us to work independently while still contributing to a common goal.
Consistent Communication: Although we were not close initially, we made a conscious effort to communicate regularly through scheduled check-ins and shared task updates. This helped build trust and coordination over time.
Respect for Each Other’s Work: We respected each other's roles and contributions, which made collaboration smoother and encouraged mutual support.
Flexible and Open-Minded Approach: Since it was our first collaboration, we kept an open mind to learning each other’s working styles and adapted where necessary to ensure the project's success.
